= Technical Documentation for Notey

This document provides technical details about the Notey application, a cross platform note taking application built using Flet. 

== Table of Contents
* Technologies Used
* Application Structure
* Data Storage
* Functionality
* Future Plans
* Code Explanation

For regular documentation go link:README.md[HERE]

== Technologies Used

* **'Python'**: Programming Language used for the backend logic of the application.
* **'Flet'**: User Interface framework for building real-time web, desktop, and mobile applications with Python. 

== Application Structure

The application is organized into a single file:

* **'app.py'**: Contains all the code for the user interface, logic, and data storage.

== Data Storage

The application currently uses a local JSON file for storing notes:

* **'notes.json'**: Stores note data, including titles, content, and unique identifiers.

== Functionality

The Notey application provides the following features:

* **'Note Creation'**: Users can create new notes with titles and content.
* **'Note Editing'**: Users can edit existing notes.
* **'Note Deletion'**: Users can delete existing notes.
* **'Light and Dark Mode'**: Users can switch between light and dark themes for the user interface.
* **'Color Theme Support'**: Users can choose from different color themes to customize the look of the application.

== Future Plans

Here are some potential future enhancements for the Notey application:

* **'Dropbox Support'**: Allow users to store their notes on Dropbox for synchronization and backup.
* **'Additional Color Themes'**: Provide more color theme options to choose from.

== Code Explanation

_**app.py**_

This is the main Python file for the Notey application, built using the Flet framework. It handles the creation of the user interface, note management, and settings.

```python
import flet as ft

import json
import uuid
import os
import webbrowser

import dropbox
```

This section imports the necessary modules for the application:

- `flet` is used for creating the user interface and handling user interactions.
- `json` is used for working with JSON data (loading and saving notes).
- `uuid` is used for generating unique identifiers for notes.
- `os` is used for interacting with the operating system (checking for file existence).
- `webbrowser` is used for opening web pages (for Dropbox authentication).
- `dropbox` is used for interacting with the Dropbox API (future feature).

```python
# --- App constants and data structures ---
NOTES_FILE = 'notes.json'
SETTINGS_FILE = 'settings.json'

if not os.path.exists(NOTES_FILE):
    with open(NOTES_FILE, 'w') as f:
        json.dump([], f)

if not os.path.exists(SETTINGS_FILE):
    with open(SETTINGS_FILE, 'w') as f:
        json.dump({'use_dropbox': False, 'dropbox_token': ''}, f)

class Colors:
    # ... (Color theme definitions) ...

colors = Colors()

class Note:
    # ... (Note class definition) ...

# --- Helper functions ---

def load_notes():
    # ... (Loads notes from local storage or Dropbox) ...

def save_notes(notes):
    # ... (Saves notes to local storage or Dropbox) ...

# --- Flet UI functions ---

def open_settings(e, page):
    # ... (Settings page implementation) ...

def load_note(note_info, page, notes):
    # ... (Loads a note for editing) ...

def display_notes(page, notes):
    # ... (Displays the list of notes) ...

def new_note(e, page, notes):
    # ... (Creates a new note) ...

# --- Main application function ---

def main(page: ft.Page):
    # ... (Main function to initialize and run the Flet app) ...

ft.app(target=main)
```

The code is structured with constants, data structures, helper functions, Flet UI functions, and a main application function:

- **App constants and data structures**: Define file names for notes and settings, color themes, and the `Note` class to represent a note.
- **Helper functions**: Handle loading and saving notes from/to storage.
- **Flet UI functions**: Implement various parts of the user interface, including settings, note loading/editing, note display, and new note creation.
- **Main application function (`main`)**: Initializes the Flet application, loads notes, sets up the basic layout, and handles user interactions.

The code utilizes Flet's UI elements like `AppBar`, `FloatingActionButton`, `TextField`, `CupertinoButton`, `Stack`, `Row`, `Divider`, and more to create the user interface. It also incorporates event handling (`on_click`), state management, and dynamic UI updates to provide a responsive and interactive note-taking experience.

This documentation explains the code's functionality, structure, and the technologies used in the Notey application. It also highlights future plans for enhancing the application's capabilities.
